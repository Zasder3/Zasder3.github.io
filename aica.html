        <h5 style="margin-top: 5%">What is Affective Image Classification?</h5>
        <p>Given a picture, we predict the emotion felt by a viewer perceiving the image. The problem exists at the intersection of art, psychology, and computer vision. Due to the
          fact that this paper is still undergoing experimentation, I can not share too many specific details. But I can give some intuitions about the problem and some of our plans.
        </p>
        <h5>Example</h5>
        <p>For a minute, look at the following image and think to yourself, "what emotion am I feeling?"</p>
        <div class="container">
          <img src="images/fear.png" alt="an image so scary it can't be seen by mortals" class="figimg">
          <div id="fig1">
            <p>Figure 1: Most likely the scariest image to ever grace your life thus far</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Don't worry it's just a drawing. We would give a picture like this to our computer model, then it would predict what a viewer like you or I would feel. If it does
          it's job well, it would predict fear. Maybe the picture was of a scenic mountain, in that case the model would predict something like contentment.
        </p>
        <h5>So what do you do to solve it?</h5>
        <p>We use convolutional neural networks to give us our baseline model. From there we seek two different methods in order to better predict perceived
          human emotions: artistic style and language features.
        </p>
        <h6>Artistic Style</h6>
        <p>We propose using a learned method to find artistic style present in photos. After we extract information from the artistic features, we attempt to use those features
          to make our predictions.
        </p>
        <h6>Language Features</h6>
        <p>We study how parts of language associated with the image cause emotion. Much of our focus is in the natural biases present within language. We hope to
          make use of that bias to find elements that cause emotion in a viewer.
