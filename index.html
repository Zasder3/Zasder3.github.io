            <h1>Generative Humanization for Therapeutic Antibodies</h1>
            <hr>

                    <p>Antibody therapies have been employed to address some of today's most challenging diseases, but
                        must meet many criteria during drug development before reaching a patient. Humanization is a
                        sequence optimization strategy that addresses one critical risk called immunogenicity - a
                        patient's immune response to the drug - by making an antibody more `human-like' in the absence
                        of a predictive lab-based test for immunogenicity. However, existing humanization strategies
                        generally yield very few humanized candidates, which may have degraded biophysical properties or
                        decreased drug efficacy. Here, we re-frame humanization as a conditional generative modeling
                        task, where humanizing mutations are sampled from a language model trained on human antibody
                        data. We describe a sampling process that incorporates models of therapeutic attributes, such as
                        antigen binding affinity, to obtain candidate sequences that have both reduced immunogenicity
                        risk and maintained or improved therapeutic properties, allowing this algorithm to be readily
                        embedded into an iterative antibody optimization campaign. We demonstrate in silico and in lab
                        validation that in real therapeutic programs our generative humanization method produces diverse
                        sets of antibodies that are both (1) highly-human and (2) have favorable therapeutic properties,
                        such as improved binding to target antigens.</p>
