        <p>This paper can be read on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03864">arXiv preprint platform</a>.</p>
        <h5>What's this paper about?</h5>
        <p>Given any dataset of videos. We can make a realistic video that mimics the dataset. This method has been successfully applied
          to images before. One classic example is <a href="http://thispersondoesnotexist.com">thispersondoesnotexist.com</a>, where a face that's seemingly
          real is actually generated by a computer. My paper furthers previous literature by making time continuous rather than singularly sampled. To do
          this we apply some tricks from calculus to formulate the problem in multiple ways.
        </p>

        <h5>Redefining videos</h5>
        <p>Most people think of videos as flowing streams. In reality, they are simply a bunch of images stitched together.</p>

        <div class="container">
          <img src="images/time ball.png" alt="the best drawings of basketballs ever seen" class="figimg">
          <div id="fig1">
            <p>Figure 1: Videos as a series of images</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>This creates the question of how to generate them. For all video generation models, a series of points are turned into
          a series of images. That series of images is our video.
        </p>

        <h5>Points in space are a neighborhood</h5>

        <p>To best illustrate this topic we will think about driving through a neighborhood. Our model drives along the street of a neighborhood, and each house represents an image.
          In technical terms our model traverses a latent space mapping a point to an image.
        </p>

        <div class="container">
          <img src="images/time car.png" alt="a hand crafted neighborhood that maps to houses" class="figimg">
          <div id="fig1">
            <p>Figure 2: A car driving through a neighborhood</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h5>Why old models stink</h5>

        <p>Old models only jumped from house to house and never drove. One moment they'd be at house one then the next at house two with no inbetween. It sounds
          illogical and it was illogical. Time isn't made of big jumps, it's like a flowing river. <strong>Figure 3</strong> shows the results of thinking of time
          like previous works.
        </p>

        <div class="container">
          <img src="images/hit.png" alt="big bang explosion boom car hits house because it's not good" class="figimg">
          <div id="fig1">
            <p>Figure 3: Hitting a house because it didn't move properly through time</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h5>Let's make it <em>continuous</em></h5>

        <p>Instead of jumping inbetween time steps we can slowly drive between houses. This also gives us the ability if we want to visit intermediate houses rather than running
          around like a rabid squirrel.
        </p>

        <div class="container">
          <img src="images/time continuous.png" alt="a smooth coast along the road" class="figimg">
          <div id="fig1">
            <p>Figure 4: A nice smooth drive down the road, unlike the sporadic dots...</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h5>How about <em>stochastic</em></h5>
        
        <p>One might have noticed that are car only goes down the street one way. They would be correct. If we start at a point, both models will only
          ever predict one outcome from the path traversal. One way that we can have either way be possible is by using stochastic differential equations.
          That would allow us to turn either left or right.
        </p>

        <div class="container">
          <img src="images/time stochastic.png" alt="a concerning outlook on driving" class="figimg">
          <div id="fig1">
            <p>Figure 5: An indecisive driver approaches a fork</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h5>What does this all mean?</h5>

        <p>We hypothesize that if we can get a car to drive rather than jump, then better videos will be created.</p>
